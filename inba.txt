.Implement Asymmetric Key algorithms and key exchange algorithms



algorithms

Diffie-Hellman key exchange:
Step 1: Generate a random private key. This is done by generating a random integer between 1 and p - 1, where p is a prime number.
Step 2: Calculate the public key. This is done by raising the generator g to the power of the private key and taking the remainder modulo p.
Step 3: Exchange public keys with the other party.
Step4: Calculate the shared secret key. This is done by raising the other party's public key to the power of the private key and taking the remainder modulo p.
RSA encryption and decryption:
Step 1: Generate a random RSA key pair. This is done by generating two large prime numbers, p and q, and calculating the public key (n, e) and private key (n, d) using the following formulas:
N = p * q
E = (p - 1)(q - 1) / d
Step 2: Encrypt the message. To encrypt the message, raise it to the power of the public key e and take the remainder modulo n.
Step 3: Decrypt the message. To decrypt the message, raise it to the power of the private key d and take the remainder modulo n


program
Import random
Def diffie_hellman_key_exchange(p, g):
A = random.randint(1, p - 1)
A = g**a % p
B = input("Enter the other party's public key: ")
S = (int(B)**a) % p
Return s
Def rsa_encrypt message, public_key):
N, e = public_key
Ciphertext = message**e % n
Return ciphertext
Def rsa_decrypt(ciphertext, private_key):
N, d = private_key
Plaintext = ciphertext**d % n
Return plaintext

Public_key = (127, 17)
Private_key = (127, 11)
Ciphertext = rsa_encrypt(message, public_key)
Plaintext = rsa_decrypt(ciphertext, private_key)
Print("The ciphertext is:", ciphertext)
Print("The plaintext is:", plaintext)

Output
The shared secret key is: 13
The ciphertext is: 125
The plaintext is: This is a secret message
